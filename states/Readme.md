## Neighboring States
Produced at [TWO-N](www.two-n.com).
How many neighbors does each state have? This map reimagines the states as regular polygons with one side for each neighbor. Click a state to see its neighbors up close!

### Methodology
When you click on a state, the position of its neighbors approximate their true relative geographic position. The relative positions are calculated using the geographic centers of each state.
